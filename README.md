# Rabbit Hole

As college students, looking one thing up always leads to another, leading to a bunch of tabs. We wanted an easier way to organize the rabbit holes we fall into.

## What it does

Highlights a word and prompts the user to inquire more about it via a built-in Chatbot. Our product uniquely encompasses the interface so that the user can develop a working tree model that shows the parent node that started the inquiry into the rabbit hole as well as the child nodes along with a query name for the prompts that were asked. 

## Account Information

By setting up a free account a user will have access to their past chats with the chatbot.
